# Caesar Cipher in Python

This project is a simple **Caesar Cipher** implementation in Python.  
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

# Features
- Encrypts text using a shift value
- Decrypts text back to original message
- Handles both **uppercase** and **lowercase** letters
- Keeps spaces and punctuation unchanged
